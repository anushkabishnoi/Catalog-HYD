# Catalog-HYD
Here's my solution to the catalog hackathon.

Instructions to execute the file:

1. Install node (my version is v18.17.1)
2. run using the command - node catalog-solution-anushka.js
3. then you'll be prompted to choose the test case to run (1 or 2)
4. type 1 or 2 accordingly to get the result

Thanks for reading the instructions! :)
